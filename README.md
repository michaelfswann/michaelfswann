# 👋 Hi, I'm Michael.

 👨‍💻 Currently a Junior DevOps Engineer for [Mercury xRM](https://wearemercury.com). I work on CI/CD pipelines using Azure DevOps, we deploy to Azure Cloud. The majority of my current automations are created with powershell: we use the microsoft ecosystem as our products are based on Dynamics 365/Power Apps. Not so secretly a linux fan at heart. Find my old stuff on here. 🌱
